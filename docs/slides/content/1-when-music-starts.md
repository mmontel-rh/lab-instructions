## üò£ Pain Point üò£

- K.R.A.P is very excited to start the project, but how‚Ä¶?
- The model seemed to behave in weird ways they didn't quite understand.
- They were also running everything locally on their laptops, this made it hard to share and collaborate on their work.



## Before we can do any AI we need data

### Data Engineer
- Designing, building, and maintaining
- the infrastructure that allows data to be stored, processed, and accessed efficiently.

### Data Scientist
- Analyzing data, building predictive models
- Extracting insights to solve business problems.

## What is data?

### Structured data:
- Numerical
- Categorical

### Unstructured data:
- Images, Text, Sound
- 3D point clouds, Video
- Geo, Graphs

![Data Types](images/1-when-music-starts/slide_4_image_3.png) <!-- {.element: class="image-no-shadow image-medium"} -->

Note:
Data is anything we can measure and collect. It can be anything from financial numbers to 3d maps of houses. We typically show data as points on a map, but there are many other ways to show it as we will see later in the EDA section.



## What is a feature?

> "A feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon."
>
> *Bishop, Christopher (2006). Pattern recognition and machine learning.*



## Let's do an example!

We want to predict if someone might have **Diabetes**.

### What columns should we NOT use as features?
- **Identifiers** (Patient ID, Social Security Numbers, etc.)

### What do we want to input and get out?
- **Input features**: Age, BMI, Blood pressure, etc.
- **Output feature**: Diabetes diagnosis (Yes/No)



## We don't just work with raw data

### Pre-processing
- Clean and prepare data for the model

### Post-processing
- Interpret and format model outputs

## What types of AI are there?

### Predictive AI
- Focus on outputting accurate answers
- Examples: Detecting dogs, anomaly detection, weather prediction

### Generative AI
- Focus on finding patterns to generate new content
- Examples: Music, images, videos, text

![AI Types](images/1-when-music-starts/slide_28_image_2.png) <!-- {.element: class="image-no-shadow image-medium"} -->



## Predictive AI Examples

- Detecting dogs
- Anomaly detection
- Predicting the weather, or other time series
- Finding and highlighting lumps in medical imagery
- Masking and segmenting

![Predictive Examples](images/1-when-music-starts/slide_29_image_4.png) <!-- {.element: class="image-no-shadow image-medium"} -->



## Generative AI Examples

- Music and speech
- Images
- Videos
- Text

![Generative Examples](images/1-when-music-starts/slide_30_image_3.png) <!-- {.element: class="image-no-shadow image-medium"} -->



## How can an AI learn?

### Two main approaches:
- **Unsupervised**: Looking at data and trying to figure out patterns
- **Supervised**: Getting inputs and the correct answers (labels)

![Learning Types](images/1-when-music-starts/slide_31_image_3.png) <!-- {.element: class="image-no-shadow image-medium"} -->



## Clustering

Grouping similar data points together

![Clustering](images/1-when-music-starts/slide_33_image_1.png) <!-- {.element: class="image-no-shadow image-small"} -->

Note:
Cluster different songs, similar songs are close to each other



## Decision Trees

Rule-based models that make decisions through a series of questions

![Trees](images/1-when-music-starts/slide_33_image_2.png) <!-- {.element: class="image-no-shadow image-small"} -->



## Neural Networks

Complex models inspired by the human brain

![Neural Network](images/1-when-music-starts/slide_34_image_2.png) <!-- {.element: class="image-no-shadow image-medium"} -->



## When do we use what?

### Clustering
- When you don't have any labels

### Trees
- When the problem is simple enough and you want transparency

### Neural Networks
- When you have complex problems and need an arbitrary function approximator

![Comparison](images/1-when-music-starts/slide_35_image_20.png) <!-- {.element: class="image-no-shadow image-medium"} -->



## So how do we train one?

### Data Split Strategy:
- **Training set** (60%): Teach the model
- **Validation set** (20%): Tune the model
- **Testing set** (20%): Final evaluation

![Data Split](images/1-when-music-starts/slide_36_image_5.png) <!-- {.element: class="image-no-shadow image-medium"} -->



## Model Serving

Why serve a model?

![Model Serving](images/1-when-music-starts/slide_51_image_11.png) <!-- {.element: class="image-no-shadow image-medium"} -->

Note:
A model sitting in an environment or on a laptop by itself does little good. Sure, you can run some files through it, but you need to manually run them and no-one else can use the model. To get the model up and running so other people can use it, we deploy it with a runtime server that contains that model.



## Models can be stored in different ways

- **S3 storage**: Cloud object storage
- **OCI artifact**: Container registry
- **PVC**: Persistent volume claims

![Storage Options](images/1-when-music-starts/slide_52_image_1.png) <!-- {.element: class="image-no-shadow image-medium"} -->



## ‚ùì Quiz ‚ùì

**Why should we serve a model?**

1. To make the trained model available for real-world usecases
2. Because AI models get hungry and need three meals a day
3. To impress the AI overlords before they take over
4. Because if we don't, the model will feel unappreciated

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->**Answer: 1** - To make the trained model available for real-world usecases, allowing it to generate predictions from new data.



## üòå Pain Point Solved üòå

The model is served and everyone who needs it can now access it!



## üò£ New Pain Point üò£

Lisa is great at what she does, so great that we now have a **myriad of models** she has created...

A myriad of models that **no-one can navigate**, probably not even she...



## Without a Model Registry

- **Accuracy**: ?
- **Location**: ü§∑
- **Training data**: What's data?
- **Deployed**: Maybe...?
- **Model type**: The one that predicts

![Chaos](images/1-when-music-starts/slide_59_image_1.png) <!-- {.element: class="image-no-shadow image-medium"} -->



## With a Model Registry

- **Accuracy**: 0.97
- **Location**: oci://...
- **Training data**:
  - Location: S3://...
  - Features: acousticness, ...
- **Deployed**: In Test environment
- **Model type**: Created by this pipeline

![Organized](images/1-when-music-starts/slide_60_image_2.png) <!-- {.element: class="image-no-shadow image-medium"} -->



## ‚ùì Quiz ‚ùì

**What kind of info do we store in the Model Registry?**

1. A daily horoscope for the model
2. A playlist of songs the model listens to when stuck in overfitting
3. A list of revenge plots against data scientists
4. Version, metrics, location, and training details

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->**Answer: 4** - Version, metrics, location, and training details ‚Äì everything to track and reuse the model.



## üòå Pain Point Solved üòå

Now we have organized, trackable, and reusable models!
