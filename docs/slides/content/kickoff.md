## Information Radiators

We'll be using various information radiators throughout the week:

- **Backlog** - Track progress and tasks
- **Work Visualization** - See what everyone is working on
- **Definition of Done** - Clear completion criteria
- **Team Sentiment** - How are we feeling?
- **Real Time Retro** - Continuous improvement
- **Big Picture** - Keep the end goal in sight
- **Parking Lot (or Car Park?)** - Questions and ideas for later
- **Quote Wall** - Memorable moments and insights
- **Stop the World** - When we need to pause and address issues

## Learners' Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Implement end-to-end MLOps pipelines
- Deploy and manage ML models in production
- Monitor and maintain ML systems
- Apply DevOps practices to ML workflows
- Collaborate effectively in ML teams



## Exercise: Expectations Setting

### What are your expectations for the week?

**Instructions:**
1. Everyone grab a pen and a few sticky notes
2. Individually write your expectations (one per sticky note)
3. Add them to a class board named "Expectations"
4. Group the sticky notes by affinity
5. Discuss expectations by comparing them to the course's Learning Outcomes



## Exercise: Team Formation

### Move to the area that best represents your focus:

- **Data Science & Data Engineer**
- **Platform & Infrastructure**
- **Engineering, Product & Business**

**Formation Process:**
- Each group should stand in a straight line, parallel to the other groups
- Each line will then form a table group
