Draw a simple representation of an animal that you feel represents your current mood.



## Back to the Animals!
Introduce yourself to the group and share your animal.   
- What is your name?
- Where are you from?
- What is your current role within your organization?
- Show and Tell: Share your animal drawing



## Exercise: Expectations Setting

### What are your expectations for the week?

* Everyone grab a pen and a few sticky notes.

* Add them to a class board named "Expectations."
* Group the sticky notes by affinity.
* Discuss expectations by comparing them to the course's Target Outcomes.

## Learners' Outcomes
#### _What are **our** Target Outcomes?_
By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Implement end-to-end MLOps pipelines
- Deploy and manage ML models in production
- Monitor and maintain ML systems
- Apply DevOps practices to ML workflows
- Collaborate effectively in ML teams



## Exercise: Team Formation

Move to the area that best represents your focus:
* Data Science & Data Engineer
* Platform & Infrastructure
* Engineering, Product & Business

**Formation Process:**
- Each group should stand in a straight line, parallel to the other groups
- Each line will then form a table group
