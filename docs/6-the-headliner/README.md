# Exercise 6 - The Headliner
>  Techniques to enhance the reliability and scalability of machine learning systems. 

## 👨‍🍳 Exercise Intro
In this exercise, we'll cover pre- and post-processing for data and predictions, explore autoscaling to handle loads, and introduce advanced deployment patterns like canary and blue-green deployments to ensure safe and seamless model rollouts.
