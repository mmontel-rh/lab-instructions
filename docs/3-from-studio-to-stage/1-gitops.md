## üêô ArgoCD - GitOps Controller 
Let‚Äôs start with GitOps! GitOps is important in MLOps because it provides a consistent, automated way to manage machine learning workflows and model deployments, ensuring that everything is versioned, traceable, and reproducible. By using Git as the single source of truth, teams can easily track changes, manage configurations, and ensure that models and applications are always deployed in the correct state.

To put GitOps into action, we‚Äôll use Argo CD as our GitOps engine.

### Argo CD Applications
Argo CD is one of the most popular GitOps tools. It keeps the state of our OpenShift applications synchronized with our git repos. It is a controller that reconciles what is stored in our git repo (desired state) against what is live in our cluster (actual state). 

In the context of MLOps, we‚Äôll leverage Argo CD to deploy our tools and models in a repeatable and reproducible manner. By storing configuration definitions in Git, Argo CD will automatically apply those definitions, making the deployment process more efficient and consistent. This means we‚Äôll be working with YAML files‚Äîso it‚Äôs time to switch to a different workbench: `code-server`. Let‚Äôs be honest, Jupyter Notebooks aren‚Äôt the best when it comes to working with YAML files and command-line utilitiesü•≤. 

Let‚Äôs create a new workbench next to the existing Jupyter Notebook workbench in our `<USER_NAME>-jukebox` project and get started!

1. Go to `OpenShift AI` > `Data Science Projects` > `<USER_NAME>-jukebox` >  `Workbenches` and click `Create workbench`

  Select a name you want, could be something like `<USER_NAME>-mlops-toolings` 

    For Notebook Image: 

    - Image selection: `code-server`

    Leave the rest as the default and hit `Create workbench`.
  
  When it is in running state, Open it and use your credentials to access it.

  If you're prompted to confirm whether you trust the authors, go ahead and select 'Yes' :) After all, we know you trust us‚Ä¶ right? üíö

2. Open a new terminal by hitting the hamburger menu on top left then select `Terminal` > `New Terminal` from the menu.

3. An Argo CD instance is already installed to your `<USER_NAME>-toolings` environment. Let's verify that it is running and login to Argo CD UI.

  Log in to OpenShift using your credentials (remember to replace <PASSWORD> with your actual password).

  ```bash
    export CLUSTER_DOMAIN=<CLUSTER_DOMAIN>
    oc login --server=https://api.${CLUSTER_DOMAIN##apps.}:6443 -u <USER_NAME> -p <PASSWORD>
  ```

  Then check if Argo CD pods are alive:

  ```bash
  oc get pods -n <USER_NAME>-toolings
  ```

4. When all the pods are up and running, we can login to the UI of ArgoCD by clicking [here](https://argocd-server-<USER_NAME>-toolings.<CLUSTER_DOMAIN>). 
   
   Alternatively, you can get the URL by running the below command and open it in a new browser tab.

  ```bash
  echo https://$(oc get route argocd-server --template='{{ .spec.host }}' -n <USER_NAME>-toolings)
  ```

5. Login to Argo CD by clicking `Log in via OpenShift` and use the OpenShift credentials provided.

6. Select `Allow selected permissions` for the initial login.

7. You just logged into Argo CD üëèüëèüëè! Lets deploy a sample application through the UI. It'll be just to give you a taste of Argo CD's magic before we use it for our MLOps reasons. On Argo CD - click `CREATE APPLICATION`. You should see an empty form. Let's fill it out by setting the following:
   * On the "GENERAL" box
      * Application Name: `todolist`
      * Project Name: `default`
      * Sync Policy: `Automatic`
   * On the "SOURCE" box
      * Repository URL: `https://rht-labs.com/todolist/`
      * Select `Helm` from the right GIT/HELM drop down menu
      * Chart: `todolist`
      * Version: `1.1.0`
   * On the "DESTINATION" box
      * Cluster URL: `https://kubernetes.default.svc`
      * Namespace: `<USER_NAME>-toolings`
   * On the "HELM" box
      * Values Files: `values.yaml`

    Your form should look like this:
    ![argocd-create-application](images/argocd-create-application.png)

8. After you hit create, you‚Äôll see `todolist` application is created and should start deploying in your `<USER_NAME>-toolings` namespace.

  ![argocd-todolist-1.png](./images/argocd-todolist-1.png)

9. If you drill down into the application you will get Argo CD‚Äôs amazing view of all of the k8s resources that were generated. These resources are defined in the Helm chart you selected.

  ![argocd-todolist-2.png](./images/argocd-todolist-2.png)

10. You can verify the little todolist application is running and behaving as expected by navigating to the url of the app. Go back to your `code-server` and run the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    echo https://$(oc get route/todolist -n <USER_NAME>-toolings --template='{{.spec.host}}')
    ```

  _You can CMD/CTRL + click on the URL to open it in a new browser tab._
  
ü™Ñü™Ñ Magic! You now have a GitOps controller - Argo CD and got it to manually deploy an application for you. Next up, we‚Äôll make Argo CD do some more GitOps ü™Ñü™Ñ
