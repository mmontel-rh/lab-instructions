## Data Science Project

1. Login to [OpenShift AI](https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.<CLUSTER_DOMAIN>). The link and the credentials will be provided by your instructor. You'll see there are already two `Data Science Projects` created for you.

2. Click on the <USER_NAME>-jukebox project. This project will be the place where we start experimenting, training and deploying our model.

3. Let's create a notebook. Click `Create a Workbench`. OpenShift AI Dashboard is pretty intuitive, isn't it? :)

   Select a name you want, could be something like `<USER_NAME>-hitmusic-wb` ðŸŽº

    **Notebook Image:** 

    - Image selection: `Standard Data Science`
    - Version selection: `2025.1`
  
    **Deployment size**
    - Container size: `Small`

    **Environment variables**
    - No need to add one at the moment.

    **Cluster storage**
    - Leave it as max 20 GiB.

    **Connections**
    - Select `Attach existing connections`
      From the dropdown menu, select `models` and click `Attach`
       

    And finally, hit `Create workbench`.

4. When the status of the new workbench indicates 'Running', click on the name of the workbench to access.

   It will open up the Jupyter Notebook UI. You need to use your credentials again to log in. If you see the below screen, click `Allow selected permissions`. That will redirect you to your Jupyter Notebook.

5. There are a couple of Git repositories already set up under your username in Gitea server. You can verify them by logging in Gitea [here](https://<GIT_SERVER>):

    ```bash
    https://<GIT_SERVER>
    ```
6. Use the same credentials to login and verify that you have 4 repositories waiting to be user for the upcoming exercises. Spoiler alert: be on the watch out for GitOps ðŸ¦„ðŸ”¥

7. Now, we'll begin by cloning the `Jukebox` repository, which contains the model source code. Go back to your Jupyter Notebook, click the Git icon, and copy the GitHub link to **clone** the repository.

    ```bash
    https://<USER_NAME>:<PASSWORD>@<GIT_SERVER>/<USER_NAME>/jukebox.git
    ```

    After cloning the repository, you should see the `jukebox` folder in the left-hand panel.

8. Before we get hands on and start experimenting, letâ€™s learn about the storage environment available for us in the next chapter. ðŸ«¡
